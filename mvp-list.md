# wickedRobot's MVP suggestions

You are engouraged to tear these appart and suggest everything gets removed, add more things or modify them. Better to spend time defining goals than time developing intricate things that won't impact as much as having a playable product.

These suggestions are solely based on what the ICON Sandbox System has plus some things I considered that system needed as I updated it.

# Actor Sheets
## Character Sheet Overview:
- Sections for:
- - Basic Info: Things shared through Narrative and Combat (name, pronouns, kintype, chapter, level, xp, dust, looks, bio).
- - Narrative: Narrative specific content, clocks, powers.
- -  Combat: Combat specific content.
- - Optional notes section.
- Click on ability and process the roll along with its modifiers
- Ability to track resources be it on dots (actions, effort, strain), clocks (burdens, ambitions), or checkmarks (ideals, exhausted, broken, status, buffs, blights).
- Popup roll settings for both Narrative and Combat play
- - Narrative should contemplate Boons/Curses, if its a Fortune Roll (could be optional)
- - Combat should contemplate Number of [D], Bonus Damage, Plus Fray and Boons/Curses, Is Crit checkbox
- Ability to click on Item and it being sent to chat with its corresponding legible structure.
- - If it deals damage, an option to deal a selected token full, half, doble damage or heal for that amount (Cancermantis recommendation based on PF2e system)
- Tooltips on actions, blights, buffs, and status.
- Drag-n-Drop Bond, Culture, Class/Job, Relics, Trophies.
- Tips and reminds on how XYZ thing works, how to spend dust, effort, and so on.
- *Cool bonus thing I'd lose my head for*: Titles change colors to match the currently active job

## Foe Sheet Overview:
- Basically just the Combat tab from the Character sheet, simplified
- Should also include things as foe type, template, faction.
- Drag-n-Drop Items for these

## Camp Sheet Overview:
- Camp info section (name, members)
- Group resolve section
- Camp fixtures
- Drag-n-Drop Items for fictures

## Summon Sheet Overview
- Similar to Foe but probably simplified
- Could have an "owner" section as Lancer RPG's deployables do

## Object Sheet Overview
- Don't really know how much other than HP should this have


# Item Sheets
These don't really have to do much other than having their corresponding descriptions displayed pretty and legible, the main desired behavior here would be for them to interact as expected with each sheet
